# DQV â€“ Dynamic QueryVault

Dynamic QueryVault (DQV) is an advanced **SQL query management and retrieval system**.  
Originally based on a simple DataGrip bookmark viewer, DQV has evolved into a **standalone query vault, locker, and dynamic discovery tool**.

DQV lets users:
- Manage SQL queries with **labels, notes, and metadata**.
- Search and filter by **title, syntax, or label**.
- Switch between **external DataGrip XML exports and internal query base**.
- Prepare for future **dynamic AI-enhanced query recall and suggestion**.

## ðŸ”¥ Key Features
- **Query Vault Mode:**
  - Store and manage your queries inside DQV.
  - Organize with **custom labels (e.g., Critical, Draft, Final)**.
  - Filter by label, title, or query syntax.

- **DataGrip Import Mode:**
  - Import and view **DataGrip bookmark exports (XML)**.
  - Read-only mode; queries remain separate from internal vault.

- **Label & Tagging System:**
  - Assign labels to queries.
  - Filter query list by label.
  - Visual labels appear as colored badges next to query titles.

- **Query Display & Formatting:**
  - Enhanced query preview with **SQL syntax highlighting**.
  - Format SQL queries using built-in tools.
  - Right-click options for copy, format, save.

- **Safe Source Toggle:**
  - Switch between **DataGrip XML import** and **internal DQV Vault**.
  - Ensures data sources stay separate and clean.
